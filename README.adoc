*Automation tools for https://www.fujitsu.com/de/products/computing/servers/infrastructure-management/[Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager (ISM)] using REST API.*

These are some scripts/examples to automate tasks regarding ISM. Of course there are much more things possible. But you can use this toolset as a platform for own extensions.

CAUTION: Please keep in mind, that the ISM advanced license is required to use the <<ISM_REST_API>>! 
 
The number of tools/scripts might increase over time ...

Any feedback is appreciated 😊.

IMPORTANT: *#Please note: This toolset is provided W/O ANY WARRANTY and is to be used at your own risk!#*

- Information

== Installation
=== Requirements
This toolset is intended to be used in Linux environments. Alternatively it can be used in Windows environments with activated WSL (Windows Subsystem Linux) and installed Linux like _Ubuntu_, _Debian_, _Fedora_, _Rocky_ or _OpenSUSE_ for example from _Microsoft Store_. You can also use https://cygwin.org[CygWin] (In this case WSL is not needed).

Following commands are required:

* https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[Bash] (including common tools like awk, sed, grep, host, openssl, ...)

* https://curl.se/[cURL] (for talking with iRMC)

* https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] (for filtering/processing of JSON data - needed by some scripts)

* optional https://git-scm.com/[git] and/or https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/[wget]

If some of those packages are not installed then you normally can get them by using your OS' paket manager e.g. `yum`, `zypper` or `apt`.

=== Setup
To use this toolset run the following steps:

Clone the repository:
[source,shell,indent=8]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/fujitsu/ISMtools.git
$ cd ISMtools
$ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/scripts
----
or download this https://github.com/fujitsu/ISMtools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip[ZIP file] e.g. with `wget` or with your internet browser and unzip it accordingly.
[source,shell,indent=8]
----
$ wget https://github.com/fujitsu/ISMtools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip # // <1>
$ unzip master.zip
$ cd ISMtools-main
$ export PATH=$PATH:$PWD/scripts
----
<1> You can also use `curl -sLo master.zip https://github.com/fujitsu/ISMtools/archive/refs/heads/master.zip` instead of `wget`.

== Quick overview
All tools below dir `scripts` (don't forget to add this dir to your PATH var) start with `ism_` in their script names. The second part of the name, e.g. `list` indicates the intended functionality and the optional third one some further description. So `ism_list_nodes` will list all registered nodes in formatted JSON format whereas `ism_show_racks` will display all _RackIds_ and their corresponding _RackNames_ in a formatted table view.

'''
=== General options
All scripts have a basic set of options. Some might have more options as described later in this document.

* `-h` for usage help
* `-i` to define ISM VA (overrides default in `.ism_env`)
* `-u` to enter user credentials  (overrides default in `.ism_env`)
* `-d` to set a debug level (overrides default in `.ism_env`)

WARNING: Please consider the <<security>>.

Additional you can define ENV vars `ISM_VA` (ISM virtual appliance), `ISM_USER` or `DEBUG` like `export ISM_VA=myism.mydomain.net:25566`, which override defaults in `.ism_env`, too. Precedence is: Commandline option, ENV var, config file.

----
<1> The `jq` tool is available which is needed for some scripts.

[[ism_chk_con]]
==== `ism_chk_con`
This command checks the connection. So you can see if you can use the REST API of ISM_VA. Additional the current settings from <<ism_show_env>> are displayed.

[source,shell,indent=8]
----

<2> This connection couldn't be established

[[ism_login]]
==== `ism_login`
Used for initiating an ISM session and setting of the required ENV var `ISM_session`. Usage: `eval $(ism_login)`. With an established session there is no need for authentication overhead when doing several requests in a row. Please notice that sessions expire after some time of inactivity!
[source,shell,indent=8]
----
$ eval $(ism_login -i 10.172.125.109)
$ ism_show_env
2022-12-23 12:15:12 -- Effective settings:
                        ISM_VA:       ism.customer.net:25566
                        ISM_FQDN:     ism.customer.net
                        ISM_IP:       169.254.254.254
                        ISM_USER:     administrator:admin

                        CACERT:       /tmp/ism/DCMA.crt
                        JSON:         jq .
----
<1> This session id is used for further requests.

[[ism_logout]]
==== `ism_logout`
Used for destroying an ISM session and unsetting the session related ENV var. Usage: `eval $(ism_logout)`

[[ism_change_pw]]
==== `ism_change_pw <filter> <new Password>`                                                                                                                                         
This tool can be used if the iRMC password for the ISM connection of a server has been changed due to password guidelines - for example by the iRMC REST API tool "chpw" - and it also needs to be adjusted on the ISM.
Recommendation: Before changing the passwords via “ism_change_pw”, a VMware snapshot of the ISM should be created so that the newly set passwords can be reset to the original passwords in certain situations.

[source,shell,indent=8]
----
$ ism_change_pw "name=TX2550M5-1-55" <new Password>
2023-04-05 19:09:24 -- Adjusting the node-password on the ISM-Site for the Node-Asset TX2550M5-1-55 ...


$ ism_change_pw "nodegroupid=10&model=PRIMERGY RX2520 M4" <new Password>
2023-04-05 19:01:42 -- Adjusting the node-password on the ISM-Site for the Node-Asset RX2520M4-2-63 ...


$ ism_change_pw "nodegroupid=10&nodetag=pw-tst" <new Password>
2023-04-05 19:06:17 -- Adjusting the node-password on the ISM-Site for the Node-Asset RX2520M4-2-63 ...
2023-04-05 19:06:24 -- Adjusting the node-password on the ISM-Site for the Node-Asset TX2550M5-1-55 ...
----

[[ism_cmd]]
==== `ism_cmd`
Basic command to perfom REST API tasks: Usage: `ism_cmd get|post|patch|delete <endpoint> [other options ..]`. You can write the method in lower or upper case letters and use <endpoint> w/ or w/o leading "/". 

Output is in formatted JSON format (one very long line). To beautify output and make it easier to read you can pipe the output to `jq .` or `python -m json.tool` for example. 

TIP: Possible tool for formatting is displayed in output of <<_ism_show_env>> at entry _JSON_.

So if you have some documentation in [ISM_REST_API] like:

image::REST_example_from_spec.png[alt=REST: Example from REST API referencei,width=800,align=center]

then you can use `ism_cmd` in the following manner:

Example: 
[source,shell,indent=8]
----
$ ism_cmd GET /nodes <1>
{"MessageInfo":[],"SchemaType":"https://10.172.125.109:25566/ism/schema/v2/Nodes/Nodes-GET-Out.0.0.1.json","IsmBody":{"Nodes":[{"AdditionalData":{},"Fabric":[],"ParentFabricId":null,"DataCenterInfo":{"DcId":null,"Name":null},"SlotNum":null,"UpdateDate":"2022-12-23T06:44:41.931Z","ChildNodeList":[],"IpAddress":"10.172.124.85","Model":"PRIMERGY RX100 S8","Status":"Normal","Description":null,"AlarmStatus":"Warning","Type":"server","NodeGroupId":8,"NodeTagList":[],"IpVersion":"V4"
... (truncated)
----
<1> `ism_cmd get nodes` or `ism_cmd get "nodes?name=mynodename"` would also be valid examples.

[[ism_list_assets]]

[[ism_list_firmware]]

[[ism_list_nodes]]
==== `ism_list_nodes [<filter>]`
List all node data (that is accessible for the user group the current user belongs to) in formatted JSON format. Output can be filtered with following filter keywords (that can be combined if nececssary):

[#filter]
Possible filter keywords are:

`name, type, model, ipaddress, rackid, floorid, dcid, nodegroupid, status, alarmstatus, nodetag, uniqinfo`

So if you want to output all data of nodes for a given _rack id_ that are in status _Warning_ then you could do it like this:

[source,shell,indent=8]
----
$ ism_list_nodes "rackid=1&status=Warning" <1>

[[ism_run_refreshnodes]]
==== `ism_run_refreshnodes [<filter>]`
Retrieves current node infos. Without argument all nodes are refreshed. If you want to refresh only specific nodes just enter a <<filter>>. 

This might be useful to update node infos after changes (e.g. FW) as ISM does this only once a day.

[[ism_run_gfupdate]]
==== `ism_run_gfupdate [-s]`
This command refreshs (synchronizes) the ISM VA internal repository with Fujitsu\'s internet repository (aka GlobalFlash). Without argument all available firmware/driver components are downloaded. When you use option `-s` then it runs in _smart_ mode which means only software components are downloaded for servers and their components that are registered in ISM VA.

CAUTION: You should have enough disk space within your ISM VA to prevent it from running out of space. The whole GlobalFlash repository needs more than 20 GByte!

As it is a good idea to synchronize your ISM VA repository on regurlar schedule you should add a line to your crontab to archive this like:

`0 23 * * * ism_run_gfupdate -s`

Then this job is done each day at 11pm.

  }
}
2023-01-05 18:29:35 -- Cleaning up.
----

Then you can see a task within the GUI that is downloading the required software components to ISM VA. Of course this task can take a long time depending on how many components have to be downloaded.

[[ism_set_thresholds]]
==== `ism_set_thresholds [<warn> [<critical> [<filter>]]]`
This command defines some power threscholds for nodes. If power consumption is about _warning_ or _critical_ threshold then an event is raised. Systems with warning or critical values can also be seen in 3D view when you select "Power Consumption".

Without arguments defaults values will be used. You can see them in the example below:

[[security]]
== Security concerns
Even if it is possible to enter user names and passwords via commandline parameters to all commands: This should be used only in non critical environments (e.g. for testing). Otherwise this data could be read by any other user (e.g. by `ps -ef`). 

The preferred and secure way to provide those critical data to the scripts is by defining those data in either `.ism_env` file, in your `~/.profile` (or `~/.bash_profile`) file or by exporting vars in your shell (e.g. `export ISM_USER=_administrator:mysecretpassword_`). 

WARNING: And of course, those files should be readable only by their owner (e.g. `chmod go-rwx .ism_env ~/.profile`)!
